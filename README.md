# pyBlockchain-basic
Basic blockchain implementation in Python3

PyBlockchain-Basic is a basic conceptual design for a blockchain to be used as a learning tool for the
technology and prototype for a production version. pyBlockChain-basic is NOT production level code rather a
playground for experimentation of concepts.

The Initial block structure is based on the following

1.Index: Index being the location in the chain ( eg genesis block index=0)<br>
2.Timestamp: When the block was completed
3.Transactions: Transactions, value transactions (like Bitcoin)
4.Contract: Code that can be saved and executed (like Ethereum)
5.Link: Link to external document store. Not stored in-block for size and performance reasons
6.Proof: Proof or work and/or proof of state
7.PreviousHash: Hash of the previous block
